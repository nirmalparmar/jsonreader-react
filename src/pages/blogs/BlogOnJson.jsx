            JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It has become the de facto standard for data exchange on the web due to its simplicity and flexibility.

          <Title level={2}>Why JSON?</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            JSON's syntax is straightforward, making it easy to understand and debug. It is supported by most programming languages, including Python, Java, C#, and PHP. JSON's minimalistic structure reduces the amount of data transferred, improving performance.
          </Paragraph>
          <Title level={2}>JSON Syntax</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            JSON is built on two structures: a collection of name/value pairs and an ordered list of values. Here's an example:
          </Paragraph>
          <pre>
            <code>
                {`
                {
                "name": "John Doe",
                "age": 30,
                "isStudent": false,
                "courses": ["Math", "Science"],
                "address": {
                    "street": "123 Main St",
                    "city": "Anytown"
                }
                }
                `}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <Title level={2}>Common Use Cases</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            JSON is widely used in RESTful APIs for data exchange between clients and servers. It is also used in configuration files and data storage in NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
          </Paragraph>
          <Title level={2}>Best Practices</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            Always validate JSON data to ensure it is well-formed and secure. Minimize data to reduce payload size and improve performance. Stick to a consistent naming convention for keys to maintain readability and maintainability.
          </Paragraph>
        </div>
      </Content>
    </Layout>
